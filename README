NAME
    Attribute::Overload - Attribute that makes overloading easier

SYNOPSIS
      use Attribute::Overload;
      sub add : Overload(+) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    The `Overload' attribute, when used on a subroutine, declares that
    subroutine as handler in the current package for the operation(s)
    indicated by the attribute options. Thus it frees you from the
    implementation details of how to declare overloads and keeps the
    definitions where they belong, with the operation handlers.

    For details of which operations can be overloaded and what the
    overloading function gets passed see the `overload' manpage.

    Note that you can't overload constants this way, since this has to
    happen during BEGIN time, but attributes are only evaluated at CHECK
    time (at least as far as `Attribute::Handlers' is concerned).

BUGS
    None known so far. If you find any bugs or oddities, please do inform
    the author.
